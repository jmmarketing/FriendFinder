## About Friend Finder
UCSD - Homework 10 - FriendFinder App using Express.

In this activity, we built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### Libraries & Modules Used

* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Express

### Challenges Faced

The toughest challenge for this app, was using multiple files to route our API and HTML requests. Making sure you have the correct file/folder structure is key, as well as making sure we require all necessary files in the Server.js file and any other necessary files.
